    Please note that it is an estimate amount of cryptocoins you can get. The actual value may be different.
    Your profit depends on network difficulty, block reward, transactions amount and fee.
    Exchange rates are based on current rates of

<p>
  This calculation is based on PPS payment mode with current pool fee, 0% bad shares and orphans.
</p>
<p>
  PPS is "pay per share", a mining pool reward system where the operator gives a set payment per share submitted
  proportional to its average worth, regardless of how many valid blocks the pool finds. This way the miner
  doesn't suffer any variance.
</p>

<p>
  Calculation is based on the following formulas:
</p>
        
<p>For cryptonote based currencies (Bytecoin, Monero, Quazarcoin, duckNote, etc.):</p>

<p><b> Reward = ((hashrate * block_reward) / current_difficulty) * (1 - pool_fee) * 3600</b></p>

<p>For Bitcoin:</p>

<p><b> Reward = ((hashrate * block_reward) / (current_difficulty * 2^32)) * (1 - pool_fee) * 3600</b></p>
