<h1>About</h1>

<p>Minergate is a mining pool created by a group of cryptocoin enthusiasts.</p>

<p>It is the first pool which provides service for merged mining. This means that while mining on our pool you can mine different coins simultaniously without decrease of hashrate for major coin</p>

<h2>Supported currencies:</h2>

<h3><a href="https://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank">Bitcoin [BTC]</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. The original Bitcoin software by Satoshi Nakamoto was released under the MIT license. Most client software, derived or "from scratch", also use open source licensing.</p>

<h3><a href="https://bytecoin.org/" target="_blank">Bytecoin [BCN]</a></h3>
<p>Bytecoin is a first CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency. A CPU-mined coin, it's primary advantages are extraordinary transaction untraceability and unlinkability features. BCN is stated to be much more anonymous than Bitcoin and all its existing forks. The developers claim a person’s right to privacy is their primary concern and strictly observe their own privacy. Bytecoin was started on July 4th, 2012.</p>

<p>BCN is based on <a href="https://cryptonote.org/" target="_blank">CryptoNote</a>, an open-source technology for anonymous cryptocurrencies. It utilizes ring signature and one-time addresses for completely anonymous payments. CryptoNote is designed in a way, which makes block chain analysis impossible. CryptoNote is focused on CPU-mining in order to make the special purposes devices useless.</p>

<h3><a href="https://litecoin.org/" target="_blank">Litecoin [LTC]</a></h3>
<p>Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world. It is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware. Litecoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining proof-of-work algorithm to target the regular computers with GPUs most people already have. The Litecoin network is scheduled to produce 84 million currency units. One of the aims of Litecoin was to provide a mining algorithm that could run at the same time, on the same hardware used to mine Bitcoins. With the rise of specialized ASICs for Bitcoin, Litecoin continues to satisfy these goals. It is unlikely for ASIC mining to be developed for Litecoin until the currency becomes more widely used.</p>

<h3><a href="http://bitmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero [XMR]</a></h3>
<p>Monero is a new coin using the CryptoNote protocol. It's based on Bytecoin, which was coded from scratch and is not a descendent of Bitcoin. XMR was launched on April 18, 2014.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.quazarcoin.org/" target="_blank">QuazarCoin [QCN]</a></h3>
<p>QuazarCoin is a new cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote and uses the CryptoNight algorithm. QCN protects your data and privacy with help of completely anonymous transactions with ring signatures.</p>

<h3><a href="http://fantomcoin.org/" target="_blank">Fantomcoin [FCN]</a></h3>
<p>Unlike other CryptoNote based cryptocurrencies, Fantomcoin supports merged mining. It can be possible with Bytecoin, Monero, QuazarCoin or any CN based coin. New blockchain needs no additional hashpower - it uses Bytecoin, Monero, QuazarCoin blocks or shares as PoW. Miners are free to choose "donor" chain they like. In case other chains based on CryptoNote will appear they also can be used as "donor" chains.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ducknote.org/" target="_blank">duckNote [XDN]</a></h3>
<p>duckNote is an experimental open-source cryptocurrency based on CryptoNote technology and CryptoNight algorithm. It is a fork of Bytecoin - the very first implementation of CryptoNote. Nobody own or control duckNote. It is a scalable decentralized cryptocurrency with strong privacy protection. duckNote uses ring signatures, to provide unlinkable and untraceable transactions.</p>

<h3><a href="http://monetaverde.org/" target="_blank">MonetaVerde [MCN]</a></h3>
<p>MonetaVerde is a CryptoNote based coin,  wich supports merged mining like Fantomoin (FCN). MonetaVerde is the first cryptocurrency in which block reward is increased when difficulty is growing. Mining of MonteVerde does not require any additional hashpower if you chose Merged Mining with the major CryptoNote coin. </p>

<h3><a href="http://aeoncoin.net/" target="_blank">AEON coin [AEON]</a></h3>
<p>AEON coin is the anonymous cryptocurrency which is based on the CryptoNote protocol and uses the CryptoNight algorithm</p>
        
<h3><a href="http://dashcoin.net" target="_blank">Dashcoin [DSH]</a></h3>
<p>Dashcoin is a Next generation anonymous cryptocurrency and the first automatically mutating cryptocurrency created with <a href="http://cryptonote.org" target="_blank">CryptoNote</a> technology.</p>

<h3><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=698727.0" target="_blank">Infinium-8 [INF8]</a></h3>
<p>Infinium-8 (INF8) is a new privacy-centric coin using the <a href="http://cryptonote.org" target="_blank">CryptoNote</a> protocol. <br>
    The open source reference implementation of CryptoNote was coded from scratch based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, and is not a fork of Bitcoin.<br><br>

    Infinium-8 aims to be a fungible and untraceable digital medium of exchange. It intrinsically has a higher degree of anonymity than Bitcoin or any of its various forks. Infinium-8 s the cryptocoin with blockreward increasing together with difficulty.
