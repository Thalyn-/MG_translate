<p><b>What is difference between PPS and PPLNS payment models?</b></p>
<p>PPLNS is a way of determining how many cryptocoins you get for your shares completed. Pay Per Last N Shares is what PPLNS stands for. 
   This method of calculating payouts includes a "luck" factor. Using PPLNS your payout per share will have a large range
    (30% more or less on your payouts), but on average, PPLNS earns more than PPS (by 5% or so) in the long run (a month or more).
</p>

<p>PPS is also known as Pay Per Share. It is a more direct method where you get a standard payout rate for each share completed.
    This method eliminates the "luck" in your payout, but can decrease your total income per share by around 5%.
    Using PPS you get a set number of cryptocoins per share of work you have solved. It has no luck involved so the payouts do not fluctuate.

<h3> Which payment model should I use?</h3>


<h5>PPLNS</h5>

<p>If you are looking to make money off of the cryptocoin network, you want to use PPLNS due to its higher payout.
   PPLNS will give you wide fluctuations in your 24 hour payout, but for hardcore miners,
    the law of large numbers states you will earn more this way. This is for people trying to mine as fast as possible.</p>

<h5>PPS</h5>

<p>PPS is for people who want to have statistics to base calculations off of for upsizing their mining power.
    PPS is not recommended for a simple mining because the payout is less in the long run. </p>
