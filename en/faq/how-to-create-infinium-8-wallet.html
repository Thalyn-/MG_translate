    <li>Make sure that daemon is running</li>
    <li>Launch simplewallet with several arguments to create a new wallet. E.g.:
         <code>simplewallet --generate-new-wallet=wallet_name.bin --pass=12345</code> 
         where “wallet_name.bin” is the file name for your new wallet, and “12345” is its password. 
         Please, use “*.bin” file extension and make sure to use a strong password to protect your funds.</li>
